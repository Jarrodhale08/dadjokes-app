## Recommendations


- **[LOW] extraneous-functionality**: Remove debug code before release
  - Implementation: Remove console.log, debugger statements, and test code from production builds


- **[HIGH] code-quality**: Remove dangerous code patterns
  - Implementation: Eliminate eval(), innerHTML, and dynamic code execution


- **[HIGH] insecure-storage**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Implementation: Use SecureStore with encryption for sensitive data persistence


- **[MEDIUM] general**: Implement security headers for all API requests
  - Implementation: Add security headers in axios interceptors (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
